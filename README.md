# Google Imitation Website
This was my first web design project. The exercise comes from [the Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/dashboard). It was built entirely with HTML/CSS and by referencing the actual Google Homepage.

Obviously, there is no functionality and also no mobile version; it's more just for practice.
I used both flexbox and the grid (in the header and footer respectively) to get some experience with those. There's also some basic style changes for hovering.
Development was on a 720p screen, but hopefully it should look acceptable in Full HD too. I'll consider this exercise finished for now.
